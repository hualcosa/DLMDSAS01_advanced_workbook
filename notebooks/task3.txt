**1. Expression of \( T \):**

The total bandwidth until failure of the dual-router system, \( T \), is the sum of the bandwidths until failure of each router:

\[
T = S_1 + S_2
\]

**Assumptions:**

- **Independence:** \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) are independent random variables since the failure of one router does not affect the failure time of the other.
- **Identical Distribution:** Both routers are of the same type, so \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) have the same distribution.
- **Distribution:** Given \( \xi_9 = 2 \), \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) follow a Gamma distribution with shape parameter \( k = 7 \) and scale parameter \( \theta \).

### **2. Density function of the variable \( T \).**

Since \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) are independent and identically distributed Gamma random variables with parameters \( k = 7 \) and \( \theta \), the sum \( T = S_1 + S_2 \) is also Gamma-distributed with parameters:

- \( k_T = k_1 + k_2 = 7 + 7 = 14 \)
- \( \theta_T = \theta \)

**Thefore the density function of \( T \) can be expressed as:**

\[
f_T(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(14) \theta^{14}} t^{13} e^{-t/\theta}
\]

### **3. likelihood function for \( \theta \) .**

Given a sample \( T_1, T_2, \dots, T_n \), the likelihood function \( L(\theta) \) is:

\[
L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f_T(T_i) = \left( \frac{1}{\Gamma(14) \theta^{14}} \right)^n \prod_{i=1}^{n} T_i^{13} e^{-T_i/\theta}
\]

### **4. Transformation of the likelihood function **

We focus on the natural logarithm of the likelihood function (log-likelihood), which is easier to differentiate:

\[
\ln L(\theta) = -n \ln \Gamma(14) - 14n \ln \theta + 13 \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln T_i - \frac{1}{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{n} T_i
\]

To find the maximum, we can ignore constants and terms not involving \( \theta \):

\[
\ln L(\theta) = -14n \ln \theta - \frac{1}{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{n} T_i + \text{const}
\]

This simplification allows us to compute the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of \( \theta \) by differentiating with respect to \( \theta \).

### **5. Maximum Likelihood Estimation for \( \theta \) and expected value of \( T \).**

**Given Data:**

- Sample size: \( n = 5 \)
- Sample values: \( T_1 = 3 \), \( T_2 = 17 \), \( T_3 = 47 \), \( T_4 = 9 \), \( T_5 = 3 \)

**We start by computing the sum \( W \):**

\[
W = \sum_{i=1}^{n} T_i = 3 + 17 + 47 + 9 + 3 = 79
\]

To Calculate the MLE of \( \theta \), we set the derivative of the log-likelihood function to zero:

\[
\frac{d}{d\theta} \ln L(\theta) = -14n \frac{1}{\theta} + \frac{W}{\theta^2} = 0
\]

Solving for \( \theta \):

\[
-14n \theta + W = 0 \implies \theta = \frac{W}{14n} = \frac{79}{14 \times 5} = \frac{79}{70} \approx 1.1286
\]


Since \( T \) is Gamma-distributed with parameters \( k = 14 \) and \( \theta \), the expected value is given by:

\[
E[T] = k \theta = 14 \times \frac{79}{70} = \frac{14 \times 79}{70} = \frac{79}{5} = 15.8
\]

**Final Answer:**

- **Estimated parameter \( \theta \):** Approximately \( 1.1286 \) terabytes.
- **Expected total bandwidth until failure \( E[T] \):** \( 15.8 \) terabytes.
