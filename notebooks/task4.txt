### **1. Proposing a Model for the Weight of the Hammers**

We can model the weights of the hammers using a **normal distribution** based on the Central Limit Theorem and the nature of production processes.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The weights of the hammers are **independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)**.
  - The weights follow a **normal distribution**.
  - The production process is stable over time.
  - Measurements are accurate and free from systematic errors.

- **Parameters of the Model:**
  - **Mean (μ₀):** 957 g (from ξ₁₁)
  - **Standard Deviation (σ₀):** 48 g (from ξ₁₂)


### **2. Formulating the Hypotheses**

Since **ξ₁₃ = 0**, we are testing:

- **Question:** Does the new system make more constant weights?

Therefore the hypothesis are:

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The variance of the new system is **greater than or equal to** that of the old system. \[ H₀: \sigma_1^2 \geq \sigma_0^2 \]
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The variance of the new system is **less than** that of the old system. \[ H₁: \sigma_1^2 < \sigma_0^2 \]

---

### **3. Choosing the Test and Decision Rule**

We will use the **chi-square test for variances**.

- **Test Statistic:**
  \[
  T = \frac{(n - 1) S_1^2}{\sigma_0^2}
  \]
where:
  - \( n \) = sample size
  - \( S_1^2 \) = sample variance of the new system
  - \( \sigma_0^2 \) = variance of the old system

- **Decision Rule:**
  - **Reject H₀** if \( T \leq \chi^2_{\alpha, n-1} \) (since we're testing for a decrease in variance)., where \( \chi^2_{\alpha, n-1} \) is the critical value from chi-square distribution with \( n - 1 \) degrees of freedom at significance level \( \alpha \).

We assume a significance level of 0.05 which means that if we trust the test results we might commit one of the following errors:
- **Type I Error (\( \alpha \))**: Risk of rejecting \( H_0 \) when it's true. Probability: **5%**.
- **Type II Error (\( \beta \))**: Risk of failing to reject \( H_0 \) when \( H_1 \) is true. Not possible to compute unless we had a specific value for the variance under the alternative hypothesis. I will refraim from making any further assumptions and computing \beta in this solution


### **4. Calculating the Sample Variance**

**Sample Data (ξ₁₄):**

1120, 802, 1042, 876, 749, 1082, 1002, 1009, 1003, 909

- **Sample Size (n):** 10
- **Sample Mean (\( \bar{x} \)):**
  \[
  \bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} = \frac{1120 + 802 + \dots + 909}{10} = \frac{9594}{10} = 959.4 \text{ g}
  \]
- **Sample Variance (\( S_1^2 \)):**
  \[
  S_1^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}
  \]
  Calculating each deviation and its square, we obtain the following:

  | \( x_i \) | \( x_i - \bar{x} \) | \( (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \)     |
  |-----------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
  | 1120      | 160.6               | 25,792.36                   |
  | 802       | -157.4              | 24,773.76                   |
  | 1042      | 82.6                | 6,822.76                    |
  | 876       | -83.4               | 6,956.36                    |
  | 749       | -210.4              | 44,268.16                   |
  | 1082      | 122.6               | 15,031.76                   |
  | 1002      | 42.6                | 1,814.76                    |
  | 1009      | 49.6                | 2,460.16                    |
  | 1003      | 43.6                | 1,900.96                    |
  | 909       | -50.4               | 2,540.16                    |
  | **Total** |                     | **132,361.2**               |

Thefore:
    \[
    S_1^2 = \frac{132,361.2}{10 - 1} = \frac{132,361.2}{9} \approx 14,706.8 \text{ g}^2
    \]

---

### **5. Performing the Test**

- **Variance of Old System (\( \sigma_0^2 \)):**
  \[
  \sigma_0^2 = (48 \text{ g})^2 = 2,304 \text{ g}^2
  \]

- **Test Statistic (T):**
  \[
  T = \frac{(10 - 1) \times 14,706.8}{2,304} = \frac{9 \times 14,706.8}{2,304} = \frac{132,361.2}{2,304} \approx 57.466
  \]

- **Degrees of Freedom:** \( n - 1 = 9 \)

- **Significance Level (\( \alpha \)):** 0.05

- **Critical Value (\( \chi^2_{\alpha, n-1} \)):**
  - From chi-square tables, \( \chi^2_{0.05,9} \approx 2.700 \) (left-tail critical value). [ADD THIS TABLE TO THE APPENDICES https://math.arizona.edu/~jwatkins/chi-square-table.pdf]

---

### **6. Making the Decision**

- **Compare Test Statistic to Critical Value:**
  \[
  T = 57.466 \quad \text{and} \quad \chi^2_{0.05,9} = 2.700
  \]

- Since \( T > \chi^2_{0.05,9} \), we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**.


### **7. Conclusion**

Based on the sample data:

- There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude that the new system produces more constant weights.
- In fact, the sample variance (\( 14,706.8 \text{ g}^2 \)) is **significantly higher** than the old variance (\( 2,304 \text{ g}^2 \)), suggesting the new system may produce weights with **more variability**.
