Let \( Y \) be the random variable representing the time (in hours) until an owl call is heard. The survival function \( S_Y(y) \) for \( \xi_4 = 3 \) is given by:

\[
S_Y(y) = \xi_5 e^{-\xi_6 y^2} + \xi_7 e^{-\xi_8 y^2}
\]

where \( \xi_5 + \xi_7 = 1 \). The parameters are set as \( \xi_5 = 0.80 \), \( \xi_6 = 9 \), \( \xi_7 = 0.20 \), and \( \xi_8 = 5 \).

##### Probability Density Function
The PDF \( f_Y(y) \) is derived by differentiating the survival function:

\[
f_Y(y) = -\frac{d}{dy} S_Y(y) = 2\xi_5\xi_6 y e^{-\xi_6 y^2} + 2\xi_7\xi_8 y e^{-\xi_8 y^2}
\]

This ensures that \( f_Y(y) \geq 0 \) for all \( y \geq 0 \).

##### Verification of PDF Properties
To verify that \( f_Y(y) \) is a valid PDF, we check:

- **Non-negativity**: The PDF must satisfy \( f_Y(y) \geq 0 \) for all \( y \geq 0 \). Since the PDF is given by:

\[
f_Y(y) = 2\xi_5\xi_6 y e^{-\xi_6 y^2} + 2\xi_7\xi_8 y e^{-\xi_8 y^2}
\]

We check non-negativity by ensuring that \( f_Y(y) \geq 0 \) for all \( y \geq 0 \) over the desired range.

- **Total Integral**: The total integral of the PDF over its domain should equal 1, confirming that the entire probability distribution sums to 1. This is verified by evaluating:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} f_Y(y) \, dy = 1
\]

This condition is confirmed using numerical integration over the range \( [0, \infty) \).

However, for practical computations, the interval \([0, 5]\) was used for the integrals. This truncation is justified by the fact that the survival function and the PDF decay exponentially for large \( y \), leading to diminishing contributions from values beyond \( y = 5 \). To ensure that truncating at \( y = 5 \) is reasonable, we compute the survival function \( S_Y(5) \) and show that it is sufficiently close to zero.

For example, we calculate the value of the survival function at \( y = 5 \):

\[
S_Y(5) = \xi_5 e^{-\xi_6 (5)^2} + \xi_7 e^{-\xi_8 (5)^2}
\]
\[
S_Y(5) = 0.80 e^{-9 \cdot 25} + 0.20 e^{-5 \cdot 25} \approx 0.80 e^{-225} + 0.20 e^{-125}
\]

Both \( e^{-225} \) and \( e^{-125} \) are extremely small values, effectively making the survival function at \( y = 5 \) negligible. Thus, any contributions to the integrals from \( y > 5 \) are close to zero, justifying the truncation.

Therefore, using the interval \([0, 5]\) for numerical integration provides an accurate approximation without significant loss of precision.

##### Computation of Probabilities and Statistics
The probability that a person needs to wait between two and four hours to hear the owl is calculated as:

\[
P(2 \leq Y \leq 4) = \int_{2}^{4} f_Y(y) \, dy
\]

The mean (\(\mu\)) and variance (\(\sigma^2\)) are computed as follows:

\[
\mu = \int_{0}^{\infty} y f_Y(y) \, dy
\]
\[
\sigma^2 = \int_{0}^{\infty} (y - \mu)^2 f_Y(y) \, dy
\]

Given the rapid decay of the PDF for large \( y \), the integral bounds are again truncated at \( y = 5 \), and the numerical results remain accurate.

The quartiles are determined using the cumulative distribution function (CDF), found by integrating the PDF from 0 to \( y \).

##### Rationale for the Visualization of Probabilities per Minute

A histogram was created to represent the probability of hearing the owl within each minute during the first five hours (300 minutes).

The process for calculating the probabilities for each minute is as follows:

1. **Defining Time Intervals**: Since the original model operates in hours, each minute is considered as an interval in hours. For minute \( m \), the interval is defined as:

\[
\text{Start of interval for minute } m = \frac{m-1}{60} \, \text{hours}
\]
\[
\text{End of interval for minute } m = \frac{m}{60} \, \text{hours}
\]

This conversion allows us to compute probabilities for each minute on the same timescale as the PDF.

2. **Computing Minute Probabilities**: The probability of hearing the owl during each specific minute is computed by integrating the PDF \( f_Y(y) \) over the corresponding time intervals. This is expressed as:

\[
P_{\text{minute}}(m) = \int_{\frac{m-1}{60}}^{\frac{m}{60}} f_Y(y) \, dy
\]
